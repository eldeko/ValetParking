TODO just after getting the pipeline to work:

JWT not working properly (User registration OK and login provides token, but does not validate) . Must update JWT implementation and Swagger.

Decide if remove unit of work (I remember cross dependency issues with services...)

REMOVE AUTOMAPPER! (Go full extension methods)

Dependency injection in startup is dirty.

SQL connection is dirty (startup.cs and DBContext has connection id)

Implement a key vault service

Reservations in SQL shows as INT ID, but in code is GUID ???

.
